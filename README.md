# Minicourse @ SBE 2025 -- Machine Learning in Econ and Finance

This is the repository for a minicourse presented at the [47th Meeting of the Brazilian Econometric Society (SBE)](https://www.sbe.org.br/en/encontro/47th-meeting-of-the-brazilian-econometric-society/) in 2025. I will cover a bit of three different agendas/applications of ML to Economics and Finance:

- Causal inference (along the lines of the Double/Debiased ML literature);
- How to model heterogeneous partial effects with ML methods;
- How to solve large-scale dynamic models with Deep Learning;

The slides are under ```day1/``` and ```day2/``` folders, corresponding to the two days of the minicourse. Feel free to get in touch: [https://rgriva.github.io/](https://rgriva.github.io/)
